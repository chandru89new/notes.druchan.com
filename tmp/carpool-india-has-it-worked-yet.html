    <h1>Carpool India — Has it worked yet?</h1>
    <span>Jul 18, 2016</span>
    <div><p>There are more than a dozen carpooling startups in India.</p>
<p>When there are so many companies around one single market, it can mean two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the market is super-ripe and profitable and large that there can be many players (thriving in varying degrees), or</li>
<li>no one has cracked it yet</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of carpooling, the latter seems to be true.</p>
<p>If we try to boil down, there aren’t many reasons why carpooling hasn’t worked.</p>
<ol>
<li>People don’t want strangers in their cars. People don’t want to travel with strangers. Saving money is almost always less important than dealing with the strangeness of a fellow traveller.</li>
<li>Flexible things like time, route etc. become more rigid for everyone involved. Not many like that.</li>
<li>Who pays what? How much? How?</li>
</ol>
<p>Cabs have taken over autos in almost all the metros. But carpooling as a culture is yet to catch on. The number of attempts at cracking this market has been quite high given a very poor rate of success.</p>
<p>Carpool startups have to make money too. So one way they make sure this happens is by focusing on corporates. (Incidentally, security is also a reason cited for focusing on corporate market, corporate emails and corporate credentials).</p>
<p>When I started making <a target='_blank' href="http://druchan.com/startupswadesh/carpool.php">this list</a>, one blaring thing I noticed was that almost every ride-share startup’s message is: <em>sharing a ride is fun. make a boring lonely commute entertaining again by carpooling</em> — which I think is definitely <strong>not</strong> what people want to hear.</p>
<p>Intra-city or inter-city, the biggest benefit to carpooling is savings. We may well be moving into a spending-economy from our traditional savings-economy-mindset, but savings is still a big thing in our culture. And that’s the message that should help carpooling make inroads into the urban culture.</p>
<p>By the way, carpooling is not new. Every village, every small town has that jeep, the bullock-cart, the chakda that other commuters on the same path hitch a ride. The reason it works sans initiation is because almost no one is a stranger. The driver/owner almost always knows the others.</p>
