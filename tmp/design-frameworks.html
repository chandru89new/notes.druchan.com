    <div><p>Fuck Bootstrap.</p>
<p>It’s the lazy creator’s guide to mediocrity.</p>
<p>I can’t think of why creators - especially with creations that involve user interfaces - would have an unhealthy reliance on frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation.</p>
<p>Oh wait. I think I know it: it’s because they are easy to use and just get started.</p>
<p>But you know what? One Bootstrap, and a hundred thousand lookalike websites/apps.</p>
<p>Material CSS? Same shit, different day.</p>
<p>Think about this. Frameworks, especially the design ones, are all about copy-pasta code that results in existing design interfaces. Tabs, links, buttons, forms. Stuff that’s there already.</p>
<p>What happens when you build things with stuff that exists already? You get boring interfaces.</p>
<p>If you don’t hit limitations right left and center when you use frameworks to build things, you’re most likely doing something that’s un-innovative, especially when it concerns the framework’s area of expertise. With Bootstrap, it’s UI. And UI is super-important to be left to frameworks.</p>
<p>Frameworks are tools. The world’s greatest tool is still a tool. It’s a means to create something bigger, better and beautiful than what the tool represents. You don’t shove a tool up the product and show it off. That’s not how tools work. That’s not how great things get created.</p>
