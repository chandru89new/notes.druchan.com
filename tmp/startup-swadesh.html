    <h1>Startup-Swadesh</h1>
    <span>Jul 07, 2016</span>
    <div><p>From a side-project that I first thought about pursuing almost a year ago:</p>
<p>Indian startups have come a long way but there’s just four or five top players in the B2C segment.</p>
<p>A list of things you can do / get done using a service/app/website founded and made by Indians:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan your tour/trip</li>
<li>Find and book hotel rooms</li>
<li>Find a house to buy/rent. Also, sell your house.</li>
<li>Find a flatmate / roomie.</li>
<li>Recharge stuff. Cellphones, DTH, electricity etc.</li>
<li>Buy lots of stuff — gadgets, books, apparel, bags, you name it.</li>
<li>Order food from restaurants around you.</li>
<li>Book a cab. Or an autorickshaw.</li>
<li>Find someone to fix your A/C. Or washing machine. Or even do some plumbing work.</li>
<li>Find carpoolers.</li>
<li>Book movies. And drama.</li>
<li>Rent or buy furniture.</li>
<li>Find coupons for a lot of stuff.</li>
<li>Calculate, manage and even pay your taxes mostly without hiring a consultant/expert.</li>
<li>Sell or trade used stuff.</li>
<li>Buy cars and bikes. New and used.</li>
</ol>
