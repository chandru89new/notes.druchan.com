    <h1>Psychology, Manipulation and Exploitation</h1>
    <span>May 17, 2016</span>
    <div><p>There’s a lot of psychological stuff happening around SaaS, ecommerce and anything to do with online sales. Landing pages, color of the CTA buttons, onboarding emails, blogpost titles, the last line of a blogpost (I’m tempted to call them endgame)… everything is crafted with manipulative psychological principles we’ve learned in the recent 50 or so years.</p>
<p>Sales is not about manipulation. Marketing is not about manipulation. Yet, psychological results are being used to manipulate people. Let me put it in a better way: we’re tricking people into buying things, paying for services, subscribing for things etc.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal: people catch up to manipulative things so what works for a few days, weeks or even a couple of years, will go out of service easily. Cue: Buzzfeed’s clickbait headlines. They stopped creating clickbait content and switched to producing really entertaining and worthy-of-perusal content once they realized that everyone was talking about the manipulative clickbait techniques they were using.</p>
<p>People aren’t stupids for a long time, dude. Information wants to be free and because there are some people who always write / speak about these things out in the open, people learn fast. People know - and eventually come to know - when they are being manipulated using the latest fad in psychology.</p>
<p>What’s the reprieve to those of us who have to sell but not go the “manipulative” path?</p>
<p>Tell people the truth.</p>
<p>Behind every psychological effect, there’s some core truth about human nature. We know the effects of priming and we know why it happens: so use that to tell the truth about why people find other services better than yours when yours is logically better.</p>
<p>Use the truth about everything - psychology, emotion, rationality, irrationality, stories… to sell what you believe will help others. (and this means if you don’t believe in the helpfulness of what you sell, don’t sell at all).</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that people react better to emotions even if it’s irrational than logic just because it’s rational.</p>
<p>But I think in the longest-run, truth trumps even emotion.</p>
<p>Sell honestly.</p>
