    <div><p>Why does it feel awkward to ask for money you have lent to your own kith/kin?</p>
<p>By the end of this month’s expenses (rent, electricity, upcoming internet connection etc.), I’m going to go under the minimum balance limit at my bank. This won’t affect much but it feels shameful to note that this is happening for the second time in the last eight months.</p>
<p>Two things triggered this. One, I put up a lot of money (and, in the process, lent a relatively big sum) for moving into the new house we just shifted to. Two, the large RD I opened to create the 50k corpus by December this year.</p>
<p>If I want to be safely out of the minimum balance limit and avoid the AQB fine, I should put money back into the account. This means asking for money so lent (thrice done), but every time I do it, the reactions I get are painfully obvious. And it feels awkward. Very much so. This is the problem with humans. A rational request is met with an emotional reaction that blocks rational thought.</p>
<p>So on the way to work this morning, I decided that I’m going to put an end to this feeling. It feels like begging for your own money and you continue to keep the tone that way because you don’t want to ruin a relationship. I’m no beggar. I’m gonna let the lent money be as it is and work out a way out of this mess I’m in. Shame is not where I want to linger.</p>
