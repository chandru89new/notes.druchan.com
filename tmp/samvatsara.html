    <div><p>Stephen Spielberg once said in an interview that, at the start of the year, he watches four movies like a ritual.</p>
<p>Like him, we are prone to watch some movies over and over again every year. There are some books we re-read a few times every year or so. While this phenomenon is quite common, what we usually do when revisiting these movies and books is skip scenes and chapters and entire sections of the work. Not always, but mostly. Despite this obvious fast-forward, snapshot-like experience of a revisit, we treat these revisits as whole.</p>
<p>But what if you sat down for anywhere between an hour to half-a-day just to revisit something of immense value to you - where you put aside everything else and spend focused-time on a book/movie that you’ve already read/watched, as if you’re doing it for the first time all over again?</p>
<p>This is what I intend to do. I want to rewatch certain movies in their entirety - without skipping sections - every year. I want to spend a week rereading some books from cover to cover once again. And I want to do this for not just movies and books but for other things - like essays, documentaries or talks, and thanks to a helpful suggestion, orchestral scores. This I want to make a yearly ritual of sorts.</p>
<p>To this extent, I have started <a target='_blank' href="http://druchan.com/samvatsara">my list</a>. It’s a work in progress. And quite obviously, things will get added as I go on my little journey of discovery.</p>
<p>But why all this in the first place?</p>
<p>There are different reasons to rewatch or reread or relisten to something. “To each their own” prevails. For me, most items on the list are intellectually stimulative: they have inspired me to delve deeper into something, to have sparks of creative inspiration and of course, leave me in awe almost every single time I revisit them.</p>
<p>To prevent an obvious imbalance from adding bookmarked blogposts and short stories (of &lt; 500-1000 words) and other such short things (like a favorite piece of music), I put a constraint to myself: I would only add things that would take me more than half-an-hour to read, watch or listen. (As began typing this, I wanted to raise the minimum to ~1 hour). This made sense as I don’t want the revisit to be a short, 5-minute affair. Yes, there are short stories and blogposts so profound that they are worthy of being re-read many many times a year (which is why I have them bookmarked). Intentional, mindful and distraction-free are some of the things I’m looking forward to, so these did not make the cut by virtue of the shortness of time they need to be revisited.</p>
<p>I recommend you make your list. It has been a wonderful experience just to jot down these things and to look forward to miraculous years ahead.</p>
