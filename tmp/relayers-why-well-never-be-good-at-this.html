    <h1>Relayers / Why We’ll Never Be Good At This</h1>
    <span>May 17, 2016</span>
    <div><p>We’re talking to online sellers but who are we?</p>
<p>We don’t sell things online. We don’t know what’s going on when people try to sell things online through their shops (or through marketplaces like Etsy).</p>
<p>What we know is what we see and read and hear - all secondary knowledge. We’re not experienced sellers talking about shit. We’re just relayers - we relay information from one place to another.</p>
<p>And that’s what we can be unless we start selling things on our own and making big money out of it - or becoming successful, basically.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the small idea of “relaying information”.</p>
<p>This is what we can be best at. We can relay the best information, collected and curated from the best of sources (authority, experience, uniqueness). As writers and storytellers, this is what we should be best at.</p>
<p>So instead of pretending to have a blog that’s a one-stop resource for all things ecommerce, we should build a blog that’s a one-stop resource if you’re looking for stories of how online sellers do something. The nitty-gritty details, the hacks, the exact plot points of someone’s success or failure story.</p>
<p>But then, here’s the thing: the quest to be different. While most blogs on ecommerce are writing bullshit listicles and tips, regurgitating what’s been written already about, there are also some that are doing a great job of “relaying information”.</p>
<p>So what’s it that we’re going to do differently?</p>
