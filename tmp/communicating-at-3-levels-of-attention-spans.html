    <h1>Communicating at 3 levels of attention spans</h1>
    <span>Oct 14, 2016</span>
    <div><p>We must write for three kinds of people.</p>
<p><strong>Quick skimmers.</strong><br>
Shortest attention span. They skim. Headlines, pictures, pull-quotes.</p>
<p><strong>Pausers</strong><br>
Medium attention span. They’ll stop when a pull-quote is interesting, or when the sub-heading piques their curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>The deep divers.</strong><br>
They’ll almost read every word of what you wrote/published.</p>
<p>It’s not necessary that every person is just one type all the time. It depends on a bunch of factors (what they’re reading, what sort of a hurry they are in, what do they want/expect etc.).</p>
<p>Given this, (and given the attention economy we’re living in), here’s what I think about drafting content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write for skimmers first. This forces you to write just the important bits of your idea.</li>
<li>Expand where you feel bits need expansion. Don’t write elaborate expansions, by the way. Keep it minimal.</li>
<li>Then comes the deep-dive. Numbers, stats, expositions, editorial opinions, stories.</li>
</ol>
