    <div><p>I watched <em>Mississippi Burning</em>. Roger Ebert called it the “<a target='_blank' href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerebert.com%2Freviews%2Fmississippi-burning-1988&amp;t=YTYxYTk4OWNlMDIxZTE1OGQ4NjgxZmY5MDMxMDc2YmM2MDJhYTZiNCxIZ3hoYkhXZg%3D%3D">best movie of 1989</a>” and given that this was the year that saw <em>Rain Man</em> bag the Oscar, I think Ebert was right in many ways. It's one of the most brilliant movies I've seen – not just of a social issue that was at its momentous peak but of the art of films.</p>
<p>What captured my attention in the way the scenes were etched and captured was something that I remember reading in either <em>Screenplay</em> by Syd Field or <em>Story</em> by Robert McKee.</p>
<p>Every scene is a motif to the entire movie. You can pick a scene from the movie – any scene – and decipher almost all the details about the movie: the racism, the klan, the North-South divide on the issue of segregation, the threat that pierces through the screen and reaches your heart…</p>
<p>Every frame is a chromosome that has the total imprint of the movie. And I think that's one of the most basic needs for a movie to be as great as this.</p>
<p>I haven't gone to the extent of analyzing other great movies (but as I write this, I'm thinking of <em>Schindler's List</em> and the scenes in it) but I feel intuitively that this is the way stories should be. Every scene not only takes you further along the storyline but it is also a mark, an imprint, a DNA of the entire movie.</p>
<p>But does it come consciously? I think not. Not to a large extent. I think it happens organically when one starts to craft the best scenes that depict the story and put them together.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that seemed like the most natural (and yet profoundly fantastic) revelation. That each scene is a complete representative of the entire movie: both in content and style.</p>
