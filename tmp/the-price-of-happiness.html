    <h1>The price of happiness</h1>
    <span>Sep 17, 2013</span>
    <div><p>A lonely Sunday evening that pops out of the blue, with no chore to attend to, no movie to watch and no inclination towards the only constant companions here: books.</p>
<p>The constant debilitating thought of one of the parents descending into depression in your absence with guilt nagging at your very existence.</p>
<p>A constantly wobbling thought train that shunts between contradictory images of a distant future on those dry and drowsy post-lunch sessions at the office.</p>
<p>This is the price of happiness. The solitude, the guilt, the indecision: it's the scary part of an introvert's life. But it's the price you pay to enjoy the freedom and the happiness of a bachelor's life lived consciously.</p>
<p>It's the price you pay to relish the refreshing morning bike rides on a trusty bicycle with the camera strapped across.</p>
<p>It's the price you pay to enjoy the long walk on a pleasant, breezy evening.</p>
<p>And it's the price you pay to be happy being just the way you are.</p>
