    <h1>Research — the two levels</h1>
    <span>May 25, 2016</span>
    <div><p>Very few people go to the extent of digging into existing research — original, authentic research — when they work on something. Be it writing a story or creating a consumer product or reporting on something.</p>
<p>The ones that have demonstrated a capacity to produce outstanding pieces of work, I think, have an outstanding ability to dig deep into original research (besides several other characteristics like being able to connect wildly unrelated things, come up with innovative, non-conformist ideas and more).</p>
<p>But imagine the mind and inner workings of a master craftsman who not only digs deep into existing research but — because he’s not satisfied with what’s existing (even though it’s good) — commissions his own research. Imagine the endeavor. Imagine the hunger for information.</p>
