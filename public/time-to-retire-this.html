    <h1>Time to retire this</h1>
    <span>Oct 27, 2016</span>
    <div><p>Product people swear by the old, hacker-code-worthy <em>if it’s stupid and works, it’s not stupid</em> thing. Even today.</p>
<p>And this has to stop.</p>
<p>Lousy, lazy, lame and vain product people are misusing it to harm their companies, their products and ultimately, the user experience.</p>
<p>The whole thing has to be retired.</p>
<p>There’s only one place where the adage works.</p>
<p>When there are no solutions that work and people are desperately looking for one, a hack does wonders even if it’s stupid to look at and use.</p>
<p>Think about this. For many years, Hootsuite featured one of the crappiest UIs but it was killing it in social media management. It was a stupid design but it worked. Why? Because there was no really good/better alternative that was as popularly known.</p>
<p>Buffer did not have a bulk-schedule feature, so people made use of a hack-around plugin that was all about excel sheets and add-ons. Not exactly stupid but you get the point.</p>
<p>These were unique cases. Where the solution doesn’t exist, a stupid solution is okay. (Caveat: till someone shows up with a smarter solution)</p>
<p>But to use the adage as a justification for laziness or because one is in a hurry or one does not want to think deeper and come up with better solutions is downright blasphemous.</p>
<p>This coder I know uses it many times throughout a project. And for what? For UI problems that he is too lazy to solve.</p>
<p>A product manager leans on this stupid adage because product managers are always in a hurry to push out an update. The resultant is half-assed, not surprisingly.</p>
<p>I know criticism is easy. Living right in the midst of such decisions and such irresponsible usage of the adage takes its toll.</p>
<p>These people butcher through carefully-designed elements, walk all over a well-thought-out process and pay almost no attention to the important little details that matter (instead, spend time talking about crap).</p>
<p>And then, when someone points out the flaws — blatant and apparent as they are — they say, “if it’s stupid and it works, it’s not stupid.”</p>
