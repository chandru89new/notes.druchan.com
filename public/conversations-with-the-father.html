    <h1>Conversations with the father</h1>
    <span>Jul 22, 2016</span>
    <div><p>We dont talk for weeks.</p>
<p>And then there’s a call.</p>
<p>There are no pleasantaries. There’s something to be conveyed.</p>
<p>And when it’s done, no more than a couple of minutes have passed.</p>
<p>I used to think, <em>I wish I had a great friendly relationship with my dad</em>.</p>
<p>Nowadays I’m happy the call doesn’t last long.</p>
<p>I’m given to understand that most father-son relationships are this way. Nice. Very nice.</p>
