    <h1>Opinions against</h1>
    <span>Jun 10, 2016</span>
    <div><p>As we all do, there are things about this world that I don’t believe in. Things that other people - most other people - either accept as defaults of the system we live in or don’t think about but follow blindly.</p>
<p>I expect this list to be updated somewhat frequently.</p>
<p><strong>1. Parents and motherhood = overrated.</strong></p>
<p>At least, on my side of the world. I’m from India and motherhood is one of the most emotional parts of everyones life. Kids are taught to revere their mother. The four primaries are, “Mata, Pita, Guru, Deivam” with God relegated to the fourth position. Mom comes first.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in this at all. While I have a repaying duty for what my parents have bestowed upon me, I don’t think there’s a need to be as devotional as in the <em>amma sentiment</em>. Just too much b.s right there.</p>
<p>I base this on multiple facets of our life. A mother does not <em>bestow</em> her goodwill on her foetus or newborn. It’s an evolutionary trait that we’ve succesfully embedded into our emotional system. I once heard someone say the mother gives life and then nurtures through love, care, affection and so on. True. She does that. But then they went on to use that to say that the child is forever indebted to the mom (and parents as the case may be). <em>Nope</em>.</p>
<p>Also, you should read up on the kind of tug-of-war that happens in the foetus. Hardly qualifies as nourishing love. It’s a war where the child’s life fights with the mother’s life so much so that it’s ready to kill.</p>
<p><strong>2. Forget birthdays. I’m done.</strong></p>
<p>Do you know what’s our greatest stupidity? The quest to find reasons to celebrate our life. A dog doesn’t <em>wait</em> for an occasion and then hit it off. It just starts being happy. But we try to set aside triggers to start celebrating. TGIF, start of the year (which is super arbitrary you morons), Diwali…. And birthdays are one of them.</p>
<p>Frankly, there’s no reason to celebrate a birthday. I can understand a celebration when one has accomplished something. The puritan in me wants to add a disclaimer to that. “Accomplished something that gives value to the people, things and beings around you”. But a birthday is not our conscious accomplishment. It’s always “I was born” like “I was given”, “I was thrown”, “I was killed” … not “I born”. Someone else was responsible. We weren’t.</p>
<p>But I’m okay with all the celebration as long as you don’t expect me to be in it. Just. Sod. Off. No, I am not going to call you up in the middle of the night to wish you a birthday. Nor am I going to celebrate with you. I’m not even going into the intricacies of the relativity of dates and how our solar and lunar calendars are not even half as accurate as the one ancient civilizations had, invalidating the whole idea of birth dates.</p>
