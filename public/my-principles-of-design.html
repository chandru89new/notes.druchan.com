    <h1>My principles of design</h1>
    <span>Dec 09, 2016</span>
    <div><p>These are for personal-use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Subtract rather than add.</strong> If it can be done without any interface and/or interaction, do it first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarity over everything else.</strong> Always ask, “does this screen communicate what we want it to communicate ‘clearly’”? Words, visuals, positioning, context… everything helps (or distorts) clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One screen, one purpose.</strong> Every screen that the user comes to lets them do one thing very clearly. What is it? Find that out and design the screen for just this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linearity over branching.</strong> All of us prefer a linear path. Non-linear, branching paths confuse us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lowest number of user-interactions.</strong> Even at the cost of losing choice or options. Even if it means we make assumptions based on guts and data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovate subtly or go all-in.</strong> Don’t be a cat on the wall. Subtle changes often go unnoticed or are very intuitive. Total changes are instantly visible (and users pay more attention). The middle-ground is muddled in confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay attention to the tiniest details.</strong> Both God and the Devil reside there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be concise. Everywhere. In everything.</strong> With words = don’t be verbose. With design elements = don’t over-design. With motion/animation = don’t over-do. In fact, don’t use motion design if you don’t have a set of motion principles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
