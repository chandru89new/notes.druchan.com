    <div><p>At work, conversations about user-generated content.</p>
<p>I think the moment you start talking “UGC”, it becomes a jargon. You slip into business mode. And then the primary focus is always about “what can we get out of it?”</p>
<p>It’s such a stupid stance in an economy where good samaritanship is evidently doing better than creative business acumen.</p>
<p>And when it comes to user-generated content, if you start by asking “what can we get out of it”, even if you follow it up with “while providing value to our customers/people”, it only shows that providing value is secondary to you.</p>
<p>No matter how much you try to convince yourself and others that you’re doing this with all good intentions, the self-serving attitude just comes through plainly.</p>
<p>Contests, promises, offers… nothing can kickstart a user-generated content campaign better than just going out, picking data from real people, real customers and showcasing it on your property.</p>
<p>In recent times, the only team that I saw do this smartly was Marmalead. What does an Etsy SEO tool have to do with featuring interesting items from Etsy shops in their Instagram feed?</p>
<p>One could argue that we’re doing it with our own Pinterest boards but that’s a totally different context. Boards are boards. They are de-personalized, de-humanized and detached. It’s not like a main brand sharing/featuring its customers’ work (or art) on its main channel.</p>
<p>For startups thinking about user-generated content, don’t start by asking people to do something.</p>
<p>If you want them post their workspace with a hashtag, start by posting your own workspace and many other workspaces you find online. Lead by example.</p>
<p>Do first. Then when you gain a bit of traction, you can ask people to do the same.</p>
