    <h1>Half-cooked Async/Await</h1>
    <span>Apr 25, 2018</span>
    <div><p>I wrote <a href="http://druchan.com/gen_id">a library that generates unique IDs</a> of any reasonable character length.</p>
<p>Yes, there are possibly thousands like these. But this is a good, basic learning experience and that’s the only reason I did this.</p>
<p>But turns out I could then expand this into something a bit more.</p>
<p>And so it turned out to be a lesson in the new Async/Await thing in JS.</p>
<p>The <code>generateID(options)</code> function is written as a promise.</p>
<p>And the <code>Generate Id</code> button/link on the demo page uses the async/await method to print the result on the page.</p>
<p>Exactly why should <code>generateID()</code> be a promise? Why not a simple, straightforward function?</p>
<p>In the real world, <code>generateID()</code> is useful for generating unique IDs. Sort of like primary keys for rows of data (or documents, if you come from MongoDB).</p>
<p>One use-case would be to ensure that the generated ID is truly ‘unique’. That means cross-checking the generated ID with the existing ones and confirming that there’s no duplicate.</p>
<p>As this process takes time, I converted the <code>generateID(options)</code> function into a promise.</p>
<p>There may be other use-cases. I’m not aware of them, I can’t think of any other at the moment of writing this. But the one above is quite important when people use libraries to generate unique IDs.</p>
<p>So, in essence, this library is instantly extensible. I put in a dummy/silly function in the library as an example. <code>generateID(options)</code> will check if the generated ID contains the letter 'o’ … if not found, it will throw an error. (You can tweak this function to do something valuable instead: like check for uniqueness of the generated ID).</p>
<p>Here’s where the stupidity of Async/Await shows up - a.k.a it’s still immature.</p>
<p>Typically, I’d use a simple <code>generateID(options).then().catch()</code> kind of a code on the front-end. You would too. But there’s this async/await fad going about. So let’s try that.</p>
<p>When you click “Generate ID”:</p>
<p>I do this:</p>

<p>But <code>await</code> cannot be used like that. It *has* to be inside an <code>async</code> function. Er… that seems stupid.</p>
<p>So we have to rewrite it.</p>

<p>Okay this worked. But hold up. What if there was an error in the <code>generateID()</code> function itself? Like, it threw a <code>reject()</code> instead of a <code>resolve()</code>?</p>
<p>There’s no way async/await can handle errors. You have to manually try and catch errors. Get it?</p>

<p>Compare this with how you’d typically handle a promise.</p>

<p>I still think the chaining is better than this half-cooked async/await thing we’re being sold.</p>
