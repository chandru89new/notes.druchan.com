    <h1>Onboarding</h1>
    <span>May 20, 2016</span>
    <div><p>The current onboarding: the more I think about it, the more it sounds stupid.</p>
<p>Think about this: you signup for an app / tool and you are shown 7 things to do. Doesn’t make any sense at all even for people who are genuinely interested in our app.</p>
<p>I strongly think that we should focus on just 1 thing that brings out the total value proposition of the app.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, what *is* our true value to the user?</p>
<p>What’s that one thing that makes our app inevitably valuable to someone looking to use social media for their shop’s growth?</p>
<p>Let them see that our app *does* that thing exactly.</p>
<p>To me, the best part about Around.io is that it continuously posts your products on social media; you just have to set it once a week. Almost no one else does this as well - even though I have many qualms about the interface itself even in the new version.</p>
<p>Every other feature is something that’s just a value-add.</p>
<p>- content? That’s great but very few online sellers that come to our “top-of-the-funnel” understand the value of sharing great content. We know people *do* use this feature but it’s not the deal-clincher. If it is, then we’re in problem: there are a gazillion other people doing a better job (interface, core feature, extra add-ons) and the moment users find these out, they’re going to jump ship. “What’s keeping them here despite the alternatives?” is our deal-clincher.</p>
<p>- rss? Data says very few people use this. No doubt this is an amazing feature, but not everyone gets its value. Also, it’s slow.</p>
<p>- gif? Just a fancy feature that should technically be part of Home.</p>
<p>The planner is what counts. The planner is what makes our app great. It’s the one thing that makes sense when we talk about saving time, productivity etc.</p>
