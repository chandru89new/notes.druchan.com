Continuing from [here](http://notes.druchan.com/post/147575404454/carpool-india-has-it-worked-yet).

The other blaring reason carpooling hasn’t taken off (yet) is pool/share rides offered from Uber and Ola in most tier-1 and tier-2 cities here.

I see that there’s a huge rush to use Uber Pool or Ola Share by a lot of commuters. So many commuters make use of it in the peak-hours (9am-10am, 5pm-7pm).

And I think as long as these rides continue (profitably for everyone involved), carpooling will be a distant dream (unless we target ‘routines’ - same route, same time, same people - and bring these all together).
