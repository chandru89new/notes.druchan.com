Peace.

At this moment, there's peace.

And then there's contentment. A secure feeling of being complete, being happy,
being full and being peaceful.

That point of time - a stretched point – where you know you're safe.

A small occasion of joy when you don't think of the past or the future or even
the present but just relish the amazing emptiness.

There's nothing to worry about just this moment, nothing to ponder on. The past
blends away. The future is ripe with possibilities. The present – it's time for
peace.

Friends: they're here. Family: it's good. Work: couldn't be better. Life: at its
positive peak again.

It's one of those strange moments in time when I sincerely wish everyone feels
this peace in their life. Not having to brood over the past or worry over the
future in any aspect: personal, professional, financial, psychological...
nothing.

Just peace.
