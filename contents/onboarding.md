The current onboarding: the more I think about it, the more it sounds stupid.

Think about this: you signup for an app / tool and you are shown 7 things to do. Doesn’t make any sense at all even for people who are genuinely interested in our app.

I strongly think that we should focus on just 1 thing that brings out the total value proposition of the app.

Speaking of which, what \*is\* our true value to the user?

What’s that one thing that makes our app inevitably valuable to someone looking to use social media for their shop’s growth?

Let them see that our app \*does\* that thing exactly.

To me, the best part about Around.io is that it continuously posts your products on social media; you just have to set it once a week. Almost no one else does this as well - even though I have many qualms about the interface itself even in the new version.

Every other feature is something that’s just a value-add.

\- content? That’s great but very few online sellers that come to our “top-of-the-funnel” understand the value of sharing great content. We know people \*do\* use this feature but it’s not the deal-clincher. If it is, then we’re in problem: there are a gazillion other people doing a better job (interface, core feature, extra add-ons) and the moment users find these out, they’re going to jump ship. “What’s keeping them here despite the alternatives?” is our deal-clincher.

\- rss? Data says very few people use this. No doubt this is an amazing feature, but not everyone gets its value. Also, it’s slow.

\- gif? Just a fancy feature that should technically be part of Home.

The planner is what counts. The planner is what makes our app great. It’s the one thing that makes sense when we talk about saving time, productivity etc.
