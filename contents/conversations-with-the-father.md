We dont talk for weeks.

And then there’s a call.

There are no pleasantaries. There’s something to be conveyed.

And when it’s done, no more than a couple of minutes have passed.

I used to think, _I wish I had a great friendly relationship with my dad_.

Nowadays I’m happy the call doesn’t last long.

I’m given to understand that most father-son relationships are this way. Nice. Very nice.
