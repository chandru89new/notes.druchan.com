We must write for three kinds of people.

**Quick skimmers.**  
Shortest attention span. They skim. Headlines, pictures, pull-quotes.

**Pausers**  
Medium attention span. They’ll stop when a pull-quote is interesting, or when the sub-heading piques their curiosity.

**The deep divers.**  
They’ll almost read every word of what you wrote/published.

It’s not necessary that every person is just one type all the time. It depends on a bunch of factors (what they’re reading, what sort of a hurry they are in, what do they want/expect etc.).

Given this, (and given the attention economy we’re living in), here’s what I think about drafting content.

1.  Write for skimmers first. This forces you to write just the important bits of your idea.
2.  Expand where you feel bits need expansion. Don’t write elaborate expansions, by the way. Keep it minimal.
3.  Then comes the deep-dive. Numbers, stats, expositions, editorial opinions, stories.
