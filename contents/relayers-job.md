Continuing from [here](http://notes.druchan.com/post/144494764749/relayers-why-well-never-be-good-at-this).

Don’t tell people what to do unless your ideas are innovative, radical, untested, novel, ground-breaking etc. Just narrate stories of what other people are doing, what’s working for others and what’s not.

The content marketing demographic is now filled with experts. The true experts, not the ones that are just writing and marketing well.

The good thing is, true experts are themselves writing very well. And they have a great audience.

And when this is the case, trying to emulate these true experts is bad. Totally bad.

Example: Where I work, we sell subscription to a tool that helps online sellers do social media. Our content strategy — weak as it is — is almost always around trying to emulate expert-speak. “How to do this”, “how to do that”, “a complete guide”. Even I’m guilty of thinking in these lines.

The more I think, the more I’m convinced that this is definitely not the way for startups trying to think of a way to use content to drive user acquisition. Or even brand building for that matter.

Unless you’re a “true expert” who has “been there done that”, don’t use expert-speak. Don’t teach people what to do. Just tell stories of what’s being done, how it’s being done and why it’s being done. Tell people why you think it works. But no more. Don’t preach.

Basically, don’t try to sound like an expert just with your content. Don’t try to be what you’re not.

We’re relayers. We should relay the best information in the best way possible. That’s what we can (and should) be good at.
