These are for personal-use.

1.  **Subtract rather than add.** If it can be done without any interface and/or interaction, do it first.
    
2.  **Clarity over everything else.** Always ask, “does this screen communicate what we want it to communicate ‘clearly’”? Words, visuals, positioning, context… everything helps (or distorts) clarity.
    
3.  **One screen, one purpose.** Every screen that the user comes to lets them do one thing very clearly. What is it? Find that out and design the screen for just this.
    
4.  **Linearity over branching.** All of us prefer a linear path. Non-linear, branching paths confuse us.
    
5.  **Lowest number of user-interactions.** Even at the cost of losing choice or options. Even if it means we make assumptions based on guts and data.
    
6.  **Innovate subtly or go all-in.** Don’t be a cat on the wall. Subtle changes often go unnoticed or are very intuitive. Total changes are instantly visible (and users pay more attention). The middle-ground is muddled in confusion.
    
7.  **Pay attention to the tiniest details.** Both God and the Devil reside there.
    
8.  **Be concise. Everywhere. In everything.** With words = don’t be verbose. With design elements = don’t over-design. With motion/animation = don’t over-do. In fact, don’t use motion design if you don’t have a set of motion principles.
