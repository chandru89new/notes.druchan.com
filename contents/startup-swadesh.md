From a side-project that I first thought about pursuing almost a year ago:

Indian startups have come a long way but there’s just four or five top players in the B2C segment.

A list of things you can do / get done using a service/app/website founded and made by Indians:

1.  Plan your tour/trip
2.  Find and book hotel rooms
3.  Find a house to buy/rent. Also, sell your house.
4.  Find a flatmate / roomie.
5.  Recharge stuff. Cellphones, DTH, electricity etc.
6.  Buy lots of stuff — gadgets, books, apparel, bags, you name it.
7.  Order food from restaurants around you.
8.  Book a cab. Or an autorickshaw.
9.  Find someone to fix your A/C. Or washing machine. Or even do some plumbing work.
10.  Find carpoolers.
11.  Book movies. And drama.
12.  Rent or buy furniture.
13.  Find coupons for a lot of stuff.
14.  Calculate, manage and even pay your taxes mostly without hiring a consultant/expert.
15.  Sell or trade used stuff.
16.  Buy cars and bikes. New and used.
