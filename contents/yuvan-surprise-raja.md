Although politically incorrect and replete with somewhat insensitive terminology, we tend to have this “high-art” / “low-art” classification to artforms - notably music.

For instance, Deva’s roadside “gaana” is treated as low-art in comparison to many of Raja’s choice tunes involving complex orchestrations and deft handling of Carnatic scales (_raagam_).

Spend any length of time being a fan of AR Rahman’s and you tend to be in circles where Yuvan’s music is seldom talked about and, if at all, mostly in a bad light. This is not to say all fans of Rahman’s music dislike Yuvan’s music but a vocal majority considers Yuvan’s to be sub-par at best.

And it shows in many of the songs. Yuvan’s collaboration with most directors is generally for “mass-appeal” movies, catering to a smorgasbord of audience-types. So the music, as a result perhaps, tends to be “mainstream”, clichèd and lacking nuance that one can expect, say, in Rahman’s creative outputs.

Album after album, Yuvan shows no inclination to handle _raagas_ (unlike his father – the OG Raja) or to introduce layers of nuanced sophistication or have a distinct imprint of his style in his songs. It is technically hard to spot Yuvan’s style if at all it exists.

So, to me, it’s a natural surprise when he comes up with some songs so technically brilliant that I have to listen to them on repeat sometimes.

Perhaps not so coincidentally, they involve two _non-mainstream_ directors who are a class apart.

One of the first songs of Yuvan that made me sit back instantly and take notice of – many years after the song had been composed, released and forgotten – was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfYdskz7YBQ).

Songs that marry an Indian-classical raaga-based melody to picturesque Western backing and rhythms happen rarely. (Sure, there’s a motley of songs that attempt such marriage but they don’t meet the perfect-marriage criteria).

That Yuvan managed to accomplish this is a surprise given he has not produced something similar before or since.

And to pick [_bahudāri_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahudari) of all!

Then there are [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrMuqOJP6Fc) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNrxhbjcFP8) songs. One of them weaves magic – and cheats by involving senior Raja’s voice – and the other is a rhythmic explosion. They don’t have much classical-dependency as the previous song but somehow, there is a unique, non-mainstream-Yuvan touch to these.

As I write this, I’m also inclined to mention that [this other song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKZ4wa4fROM) is also a masterpiece from Yuvan’s stable and you will then notice a pattern emerging.

Yuvan’s best, nuanced, thematic and layered work seems to emerge when he teams up with folks like Ram, Vasanth, Ameer etc.
