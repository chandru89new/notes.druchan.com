*   Always know your monthly core expenses (the inevitables). These are rent, internet, electricity, and the monthly investments (insurance, RD). This will give you a sense of how much you can spend on other things.
*   Always have a recurring monthly deposit running. Even a tiny amount. Ideally, the goal is: the maturity from this recurring pays your annual insurances and then some extra cash for use/re-investment.
*   Always have one large chunk (50k+) in a fixed deposit. This is the emergency fund in case of dire situtations. Try to grow this fund every year or try to add more such funds every year.
*   Want to go on a tour? Or buy something? Plan at least 3 months in advance, find out how much your total expense will be, divide by 3, and start an RD for that amount. Never buy impulsively.
*   The residual from every month goes into an FD or a tax-saver.
*   Exercise self-restraint and self-control before deciding to spend on anything.
