One thing I am unnecessarily proud of is my writing on this blog. This is a tale of undoing that pride.

\*

[Claude Code](https://anthropic.com/claude-code) is marketed as an AI tool that can help you write code, fix bugs, and supercharge productivity as a programmer. It works when you run it in the folder that contains all your "source" files. It is amazing as an everyday tool where I invoke it as a pair programming buddy, as a senior expert for strategy, as a troubleshooter, an an extra pair of eyes for code review and so on.

Underneath the actual program of Claude Code is the large-language-model AI that can do much more than just write code or fix bugs or supercharge your productivity. For all intents and purposes, it's the same AI that we use on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), which can write poetry just as well as it can write an entire prototype of a web application.

Naturally, it occurred to me that I could run Claude Code on this blog — which exists as a folder on my machine, synced to a [repository](https://github.com/chandru89new/notes.druchan.com) for safekeeping — and ask it to "review my writing style".

**Me**: _read all files in the posts folder and give me 5 critical points about the writing style, language, grammar etc._

Claude, the ever-nice butler, did my bidding.

Unfortunately for my ignorant ass, "critical" meant criticism. Like, "these parts of your writing are bad." Not for Claude.

After a short perusal, Claude replied:

1. Highly personal and contemplative voice: ...
2. Sophisticated sentence structure with deliberate pacing: ...
3. Code-switching between technical and literary registers:...
4. Rich use of italicization for emphasis and voice: ...
5. Minor but consistent punctuation and style inconsistencies: ...

Under each point, it went on to "praise" the style. "The author favours complex, layered sentences that build meaning gradually," or "the writing demonstrates remarkable versatility..."

Since I am not Donald Trump looking for perennial praise from my minions, I refined my "ask".

**Me**: _be critical, what is wrong with the writing style? and how can it be improved?_

And the floodgates of "ouch, that hurt" opened up.

Claude, in going through my posts, found an [older write-up about writing clearly](https://notes.druchan.com/writing-for-people-6-rules) and [communication](https://notes.druchan.com/communicating-at-3-levels-of-attention-spans) and decided to use them as the yardstick to measure all other writing.

Here's some of the choice criticisms it reported:

**Claude**:

- Chronic self-indulgence and meta-commentary. The writing is plagued with excessive navel-gazing and meta-commentary about writing itself.
- Pretentious vocabulary and complex sentence structure. The writing suffers from what could be called "intellectual peacocking", using complex phrases when simpler words could be clearer.
- Many posts start with throat-clearing rather than hooks.

I watched as it used that yardstick to whack my writing:

- Use your "communicating at 3 levels" principle: lead with what skimmers need to know. Stick to one main idea per paragraph.
- Apply your own design principle: "Be concise. Everywhere. In everything."
- Failure to apply your own principle. The author writes about clarity, conciseness and subtraction in design, yet the blog posts violate these principles repeatedly. The gap between preached and practiced undermines credibility.

In one fell swoop, Claude decided to decimate my personal writing.

But I recovered enough to tell Claude that the yardstick was wrong. Personal writing, while being communicative, is an art too. It doesn't have to confine to the dictates of business or organisational communication. It is allowed to be "flowery".

**Me**: _but the author's writing about principles of writing is for market audience. other posts are for a literary audience. how about now?_

Here, Claude got a lot sharper and offered a bunch of "literary" criticisms.

**Claude:**

- The author struggles with the fundamental challenge of personal essays: weaving narrative and reflection seamlessly. (Claude basically said, "Go read Joan Didion or James Baldwin, brother.")
- The frequent meta-commentary suggests an author afraid to fully commit to their own experience.
- Many essays try to cover too much ground.
- The author has genuine lyrical gift but often overwrites, piling on modifiers and metaphors until the natural poetry is buried.

Claude went on to call my writing "inconsistent literary voice" and — in a beautiful moment of [today-I-learned](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TIL) — "unearned profundity".

- Some philosophical conclusions feel unearned — the author hasn't done enough work to justify the weight of their pronouncements.

_Unearned profundity_ has stayed with me since.

Whatever little aesthetic exists in my writing comes primarily from two writers. One of them is Maria Popova, who runs (among a hundred things), the [Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/) (erstwhile-Brainpickings). What if I ask Claude to critique one of her essays?

**Me:** _read [this essay](https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/08/26/david-rothenberg-pond-sounds/) and tell me how can the writing be improved?_

Claude decided to shine a negative light on things that I personally think makes Maria's writing unique and interesting.

Of particular beauty is her ability to abstract and connect disparate ideas without expending too many words to explain or justify such abstractions and connections. Claude took issue with that: "excessive abstraction without grounding" and "weak connective tissue between ideas", it complained.

Claude also stabbed at the writing with a "purple prose" critique: "the ornate language often says less than simpler phrasing would." This is true, Maria's writing is very ornate and that's very intentional. The ornamentation is not a dressing, it's very much part of the message.

"The ending trails off into vague spirituality; the reader is left with pretty words but no clear sense of what they've learned." This sounded like the complaint I've heard from one too many layman movie-critiques who are unable to process vague, non-conclusive, open-ended climaxes.

Claude also took exception to the use of quotations. Here, Claude lacks context so I would let this one pass. [Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/) is essays about the beauty of ideas in other people's writings, pronouncements, poems, and other creative work. So profuse quotations are the norm.

Reading the criticisms, a pattern emerged. Claude was looking at writing from Thoreau's, "Simplify, simplify, simplify" lens.

**Me:** _you seem to look at writing from a homogenous "simplicity" standpoint. writing is art. art could be sometimes superfluous, jump between ideas abruptly, have open-ended conclusions or even non-conclusions etc._

And Claude made a drastic U-turn, a curious and annoying quirk that all LLMs exhibit unless specifically tweaked and cajoled and prompted to not do. (Other than in very objective realms, if you told Claude/ChatGPT it was wrong about something, it would readily agree with you.)

Suddenly, **Claude**, about her writing:

- ...and it's "flaws" I identified are actually conscious aesthetic choices.
- the open-ending invites continued reflection rather than providing closure, which would kill the essay's contemplative spirit.

In a flash of musical analogy, Claude admitted: "My critique was saying _this baroque music has too many notes_ when the abundance **is** the aesthetic."

And it went on to rationalise itself: "the real question for literary writing is not _is this clear and concise?_ but _does this create the intended experience in the reader?_" and it gave Maria's writing a big kudos for meeting this renewed understanding of aesthetics and literary standards.

When I asked Claude to now use the same metrics to analyse my posts, it switched to what I like to call "toxic positivity". Effectively, it said, of my writing, _these are not failed attempts at clarity—they're successful examples of literary writing that prioritizes depth, complexity, and aesthetic experience over efficient communication. The "meandering" and "open-endedness" create space for readers to inhabit and reflect, which is exactly what good literary essays should do."_

Feels like pandering, much? To me it did.

So:

**Me**: _now you are just being completely positive. critique them._

To which, finally, Claude gave in:

**Claude:** You're right - I was overcorrecting into uncritical praise.

And it went on to summarise the writing style as, _promising but underdeveloped. Good eye for human detail, weak execution of literary ambition. The writing is technically competent but aesthetically timid, never risking the kind of genuine vulnerability that makes literary writing necessary rather than merely pleasant._

And in the most damning (and probably very true) indictment: _the author needs to stop performing depth and start actually going deep._

What does it mean to be critiqued by an AI? How much humanesque-subjectivity does a statistical algorithm bring to the idea of literary criticism? When it critiques, should we think of it as some kind of a mathematically-dense-proof-of-intelligence doing what an English professor would do or, in reductionist terms, is it just a probability machine constructing a lifeless but semantically-meaningful criticism a few tokens at a time? Or both? Critique of the written (nay, typed) word is fine — the artefacts to be critiqued are in the AI/LLM's own native medium, words. What about critique of a painting? Or music? Or a game? Or a feature-length movie?

And more such thoughts arose in what seems like vindication of Claude's quip about meta-commentary.

I do not know. The scientific way to approach this is just as dense as the philosophical way so I am going to park this for later.

As a parting shot, since I wrote this piece following a variant of the McPhee method as [narrated by Somers](https://jsomers.net/blog/the-mcphee-method), I asked Claude to critique Somer's own writing, a piece on Stephen Wolfram and how we do science ([The Scientific Paper is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)).

And Claude said: _This is ambitious science journalism undone by lack of editorial discipline... Somers needed an editor to cut 1,500 words of personality profiling and refocus on the institutional story._

Somers weaves between that "institutional story" and Wolfram's profile (because he needs to talk about Wolfram's magnificent computation engine), and he does that in the most human way: a narrative that jumps, that philosophises, that cuts between disparate things, that presents facts and then ponders over the possibilities and so much more. It's not merely reportage; it's storytelling via the printed word.

Somers is a fabulous writer, and a human one at that.

Claude, and all other GPTs today, are smart as hell. But not human.

Human or not, Claude dethroned the ego and replaced it with all-too-familiar imposter-syndrome in its place.
