Cellular automata is a fun topic and Conway's Game of Life is a very popular cellular automaton.

In the previous Elm-specific post, I covered on [how to render a basic calendar](https://dev.to/druchan/how-to-render-a-basic-calendar-ui-in-elm-hih). In this one, let's write an application that implements Conway's Game of Life.

## Rules of the game

Apparently there are many versions of [the "game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) but the basic rules are:

- a "live" cell will live in the next generation if it has exactly 2 or 3 "live" neighbors
- a "live" cell will die if it has less than 2 or more than 3 "live" neighbors
- a "dead" cell will come alive if it has exactly 3 "live" neighbors
- a "dead" cell will remain dead if it has less than 3 neighbors.

The trick for us is to figure out what it means to be a "neighbor" in the programmatic sense.

## What's a good data structure?

**Conway's game of life is laid out as a grid containing lots of cells.**

For simplicity, we'll take a square grid. Example, a 15x15 grid will have 225 cells. We can start off with that.

**We need to know if a cell is alive or dead.** So we could model a cell like this:

```elm
type alias Cell = { status : Status }
type Status = Alive | Dead
```

But of course, we'd also need to know **where that cell is located in the grid** because we'd need to that to compute the neighbors...

```elm
type alias Cell = { status : Status, position : Position }
type Status = Alive | Dead
type alias Position = (RowId, ColumnId)
type alias RowId = Int
type alias ColumnId = Int
```

That is, we just represent a cell as: a row index, a column index (these two locate the cell's position in the grid) and then the status which tells us whether the cell is alive or dead.

The grid is just a list of cells. So:

```elm
type alias Grid = Array Cell
```

Why `Array` instead of `List`?

- Eventually, we'd need to work out the neighboring cells of a cell.
- This involves filtering the cells.
- `Array`s are faster when it comes to such accesses.
- Hence, using `Array` instead of `List`.

## 1. How to render a board?

We have our types defined.

Let's now try and render a sample grid.

To get a sample grid, I'm going to use a [random generator](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/Random).

#### Generating a random Grid

The logic is this:

- start with a "random cell generator" â€“ takes a rowId, a columnId and returns a cell generator where the `status` could be dead or alive (with a 40/60 odds).
- use this generator to create a Grid generator that can generate a list of cells when called

First, the random cell generator:

```elm
randomCellGenerator : RowId -> ColumnId -> Random.Generator Cell
randomCellGenerator rowId columnId =
    let position = (rowId, columnId)
    in
    Random.weighted (40, { position = position, status = Alive })
        [ (60, { position = position, status = Dead }) ]
```

Then, we use this in our Grid generator:

```elm
randomGridGenerator : Int -> Random.Generator Grid
randomGridGenerator size =
		-- create a List that starts with 1, and goes up to the size of the grid
    List.range 1 ((size * size))
    -- now map the list created above
    |> List.map
            (\cellId ->
                let
                    remainder =
                        remainderBy size cellId

                    rowId =
                        if remainder /= 0 then
                            (cellId // size) + 1

                        else
                            cellId // size

                    -- this creates the rowId
                    columnId =
                        if remainder == 0 then
                            size

                        else
                            remainder

                    -- this creates the columnId
                in
                randomCellGenerator rowId columnId
            )
    -- the above step returns a `List (Generator Cell)` but we need `Generator (List Cell)` so we `sequence` it. For this we use the `Random.Extra` package
    |> Random.Extra.sequence
    -- and finally convert it into an Array.
    |> Random.map (Array.fromList)
```

The random generator `Generator Grid` is not useful on its own.

We need to run the generator (so it generates the Grid) and for that, we need a `Msg`.

```elm
type Msg
    = UpdateGrid Grid

type alias Model =
    { grid : Grid, size : Int }

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        UpdateGrid grid ->
            ({ model | grid = grid }, Cmd.none)

init : () -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init _ =
    let
        size =
            15
    in
    ( { grid = Array.empty, size = size }, Random.generate UpdateGrid (randomGridGenerator size) )
```

In the `init` function, I'm generating a 15x15 grid.

#### Rendering the Grid

Again, simple composition here.

- First, we write a function that renders a cell.
- Then, we use this to compose the function that writes an entire grid.
- We'll use CSS grid for layout.

The function that renders a cell:

```elm
viewCell : Cell -> Html Msg
viewCell { status, position } =
    case status of
        Alive ->
            div
                [ Attr.style "background-color" "black"
                , Attr.style "width" "16px"
                , Attr.style "height" "16px"
                , Attr.style "border" "1px solid black"
                ]
                [ text "" ]

        Dead ->
            div
                [ Attr.style "background-color" "white"
                , Attr.style "width" "16px"
                , Attr.style "height" "16px"
                , Attr.style "border" "1px solid black"
                ]
                [ text "" ]
```

Now, the grid renderer:

```elm
viewGrid : Model -> Html Msg
viewGrid { grid, size } =
    div
        [ Attr.style "display" "grid"
        , Attr.style "gap" "0"
        , Attr.style "grid-template-columns" ("repeat(" ++ String.fromInt size ++ ",16px)")
        ]
        (Array.map viewCell grid |> Array.toList)

-- simply map over the grid (which is an array) using the `viewCell` function, but convert that into a `List` because it's easier to deal with `List (Html Msg)` in view/render functions in Elm.
```

And finally:

```elm
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    viewGrid model
```

If we [ran this application now](https://ellie-app.com/nwB38nKQtR3a1), we get something like this:

![grid render](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lv1ws311q2t16gh2zxx0.png)

## 2. Computing the "next" generation of the app

Conway's game of life proceeds by moving to the "next" generation. Each "step" is going to the next generation.

**Next generation basically means which cells survive and which die.**

To compute this, we need two things:

- who are the **neighbors**?
- what are their **statuses**?
- what are the rules for a cell to survive, die or revive depending on its neighbors?

First, the neighbors:

Imagine a cell at the center...

![neighboring cells](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9mhheisl0qgwxzmanamq.png)

The neighboring cells are:

- top-left == rowId-1, columnId-1
- top == rowId-1, columnId
- top-right == rowId-1, columnId+1
- left = columnId-1
- right = columnId+1
- bottom-left == rowId+1, columnId-1
- bottom == rowId+1, columnId
- bottom-right == rowId+1, columnId+1

Sometimes, some of these neighbors may not exist. Example: top-left-most cell (ie, start of the grid) does not have a top-\* or left neighbor.

But that's okay.

**We know the formula for neighbors now. We can use this to get a list of "valid" neighboring cells.**

```elm
isTopLeft : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isTopLeft ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    rowId == Tuple.first position - 1 && columnId == Tuple.second position - 1


isTop : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isTop ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    rowId == Tuple.first position - 1 && columnId == Tuple.second position


isTopRight : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isTopRight ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    rowId == Tuple.first position - 1 && columnId == Tuple.second position + 1


isLeft : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isLeft ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    Tuple.first position == rowId && columnId == Tuple.second position - 1


isRight : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isRight ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    Tuple.first position == rowId && columnId == Tuple.second position + 1


isBottomLeft : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isBottomLeft ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    rowId == Tuple.first position + 1 && columnId == Tuple.second position - 1


isBottom : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isBottom ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    rowId == Tuple.first position + 1 && columnId == Tuple.second position


isBottomRight : Position -> Cell -> Bool
isBottomRight ( rowId, columnId ) { position } =
    rowId == Tuple.first position + 1 && columnId == Tuple.second position + 1


getNeighboringCells : Cell -> Grid -> Array Cell
getNeighboringCells cell grid =
    Array.filter
        (\cell_ ->
            isTopLeft cell_.position cell
                || isTopRight cell_.position cell
                || isTop cell_.position cell
                || isLeft cell_.position cell
                || isRight cell_.position cell
                || isBottomLeft cell_.position cell
                || isBottomRight cell_.position cell
                || isBottom cell_.position cell
        )
        grid
```

We can test this in a Debug statement:

```bash
> getNeighboringCells { status = Alive, position = ( 1, 1 ) } grid

Array.fromList [{ position = (1,2), status = Dead },{ position = (2,1), status = Dead },{ position = (2,2), status = Dead }]
```

Now that we have the neighbors (and their status), we can compute if the cell will be alive, dead or revived from death.

These are the rules:

- a "live" cell will live in the next generation if it has exactly 2 or 3 "live" neighbors
- a "live" cell will die if it has less than 2 or more than 3 "live" neighbors
- a "dead" cell will come alive if it has exactly 3 "live" neighbors
- a "dead" cell will remain dead if it has less than 3 neighbors.

```elm
newStatusOfCell : Cell -> Grid -> Cell
newStatusOfCell cell grid =
    let
        neighboringCells =
            getNeighboringCells cell grid

        totalCellsAlive =
            Array.filter (\{ status } -> status == Alive) neighboringCells |> Array.length
    in
    case cell.status of
        Alive ->
            if totalCellsAlive == 2 || totalCellsAlive == 3 then
                { cell | status = Alive }

            else
                { cell | status = Dead }

        Dead ->
            if totalCellsAlive == 3 then
                { cell | status = Alive }

            else
                cell
```

It's worth adding a "Next" Msg to our app so it's easy to test the above function right away.

```elm
type Msg
    = UpdateGrid Grid
    | Next -- the new Msg

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        UpdateGrid grid ->
            ( { model | grid = grid }, Cmd.none )

        Next ->
            ( { model | grid = Array.map (\cell -> newStatusOfCell cell model.grid) model.grid }, Cmd.none )

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [viewGrid model, div [] [ button [ onClick Next ] [text "Next Gen"] ] ]

```

This renders a "Next Gen" button under the grid and clicking that advances the grid to the next generation. [You can fiddle around with the app at this stage here](https://ellie-app.com/nwBTFj64qZ5a1)

## 3. Making the grid come alive

The final step is to make the grid come alive. **That is, it should step to the next generation automatically!**

To do this, we'll add a `Tick` Msg that calls itself. Since we have the `Next` msg that computes the next generation of the board, we can re-use that!

```elm
type Msg
    = UpdateGrid Grid
    | Next
    | Tick -- we added a new Msg type


update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        UpdateGrid grid ->
            -- existing code as is

        Next ->
            -- existing code as is

        Tick ->
            let
                ( newModel, _ ) =
                    update Next model -- grab the new model/grid
            in
            ( newModel
            , Task.perform (\_ -> Tick) (Process.sleep 1000.0)
            )
```

I'm using `Process.sleep` to mimic the behavior of Javascript's `setTimeout`. And then I use the `Task.perform` to _perform_ some task â€“ in this case, `(\_ -> Tick)`.

To trigger this, we'll add a `Start` button:

```elm
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ viewGrid model
        , div []
            [ button [ onClick Next ] [ text "Next Gen" ]
            , button [ onClick Tick ] [ text "Start" ]
            ]
        ]
```

![final render](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ynmlwn45cptad7xafi28.png)

If you now click on the `Start` button, the grid starts changing every second, essentially moving to the next generation.

And the cells live/die or come alive depending on the rules.

[Here's the final output you can play with](https://ellie-app.com/nwCyhPmDfFja1).

You could try and add more features:

- a "Pause" function.
- a way to stop the game when either every cell dies or when it reaches an equilibrium.
- configurable size of the grid.
